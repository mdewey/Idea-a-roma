# Intro to Blazor!

This is a sample project for working with [Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.0)

## To get started

If you want to follow along, you will need .NET Core 3.0 install as well as a IDE (I like VS Code).

## Clone!

To make sure we are on the same page, clone this repo to get started or, create a new client side Blazor template
